### Payload For joining two collection so that we can pull data from other collection
# The template

{
    "$lookup":
    {
        "from": <collection to join,
        "localField": <field from the input documents>,
        "foreginField": <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
        "as": <output array field - can be string
    }
}

# Normal Payload
[
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "users",
            "localField": "_id",
            "foreginField": "_id",
            "as": "joined"
        }
    }
]


# Better Payload, because it will works even if we don't have a maching value in the two collections

[
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "users",
            "pipeline": [{ "$match" : { "_id" : {"$ne": ""} } }],
            "as": "userinfo"
        }
    }
]

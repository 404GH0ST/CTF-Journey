# Solution

I create a little script to dump all the uuencoded stream to a `streams` directory, just close the script if it's hang because it has done its job. Then copy the `decode_all_streams.sh` to that directory, go to that directory then run the script.

Run `grep -R "flag{"` to find which file contains the flag.
